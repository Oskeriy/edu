# Now, let's get to some simple functions, such as print
print()  # - this will print out the line break

print(1)
a = 2
print(a)

# Note that when you change the value inside a function,
# instead of reassigning it, the value of the variable will not change

print(a + 5)  # will print out 7
print(a)  # will print out 2, since the value itself is not changed
a = a + 5
print(a)  # this will print out 7
